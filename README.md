# COMP-2220-Programming-1
Some of the C++ chapter projects completed during the COMP 2220 Programming 1 class at Northwest Nazarene University. Completed Freshman year, SPR2022 semester.
This repo contains projects for chapters 3-6 as they are the chapter projects that yielded usable, complete (albeit small) console applications demonstrating 
fundamental c++ concepts. Sprint5 is the semester project. 

## File Structure
Each project file was generated by Visual Studio's file structure. Thus, the .sln files can be used to open my project solution in visual studio, or the .cpp and .h
files can be used to see my project code right here in github or any text editor. Main.cpp files will be found under <project_name>/<project_name>/<project_name>.cpp
where <project_name>.cpp is the main project file. <project_name>.exe files can be found under <project_name>/Debug if wanting to run the console app through a file 
explorer. For Ch4 and Sprint5's projects, the data files are in the same folder as the main.cpp.

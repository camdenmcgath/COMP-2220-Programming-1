# Speed and Distance Functions
This program is a modification of the [Chapter 4 speed and distance](https://github.com/camdenmcgath/COMP-2220-Programming-1/tree/master/SpeedDistanceCh4Prog1) assignment. Many blocks of code were changed to be implemented 
as functions in this project to increase readability, functionality, and overall practice c++ functions. A driver function was
also added to the main menu that has hardcoded values instead of user input to test the program.

# Sprint5: Semester Project
This project works with reading a vpu csv file containing hundreds of lines of waypoint data and combines functionality
from other projects completed throughout the course. It also takes in a user latitudeand longitude and can output either
the 100 closest waypoints to the user's waypoint, or the single closest. This project uses abasic selection sorting algorithm
to order the waypoint distances. finally, this project can not only output this data to the consolebut write waypoint data to
a tie-point file. The best way to understand what this project is capable of is to test out all of its menu options!!
